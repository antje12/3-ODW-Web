Install Angular with: npm install -g @angular/cli

Create a new Angular application with: ng new CarDB
(just say N to routing and stick to CSS styling)
Start the application with: ng serve

Check that you can access the served page at http://localhost:4200

Change src/app/app.component.html (add/remove HTML
elements) while ng serve is running and check whether the
changes appear

npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new CarDB
cd CarDB
ng serve
